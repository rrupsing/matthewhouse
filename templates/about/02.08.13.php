<p>Congratulations to Anne Woolger, Matthew House founder and Executive Director, who was a recipient of the Queen Elizabeth II Diamond Jubilee Medal. This prestigious award is given to citizens who have made a significant contribution to a particular community within Canada. Anne's long-standing commitment to welcoming and assisting refugees, and her role as an advocate for the rights of refugees, merit this distinguished recognition. The entire Matthew House family joins in warmly congratulating Anne on this achievement. The medal was presented at a ceremony at Roy Thompson Hall on February 6, 2013. </p>
