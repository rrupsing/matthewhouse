<h6><img alt="" height="307" src="site/ywd_trialsite_1564/assets/images/DundasHouse-1.jpg" width="700" /><span style="color: rgb(0, 121, 193); font-size: 18px; line-height: 21px;">DUNDAS STREET WEST</span></h6>
<p>Our primary shelter on Dundas Street West, near Trinity Bellwoods Park, provides a welcoming home for approximately 80 newly-arrived refugee claimants each year. An average of 12 residents stay at one time, for approximately six to eight weeks.</p>
<p>Residents typically share a bedroom with a roommate, and everyone contributes by completing assigned daily chores. There is also one larger bedroom that can accommodate a family. Volunteers prepare lunch and dinner each day, and residents eat these meals together around the big dining room table. Weekly orientation sessions and house meetings give residents a chance to get to know each other. A volunteer Night Manager lives in the house to ensure round-the-clock support is available.</p>
<p>Our staff offices are located at the Dundas Street West house and most of the primary public relations occur at this home. The garage serves as storage for donated furniture and household items, used to equip residents when they are ready to move out into their own homes.</p>

<p>Our Shirley Street home provides transitional housing, giving vulnerable residents, like unaccompanied minors, a longer period of time to adjust and find a place to live. Residents live independently here (doing their own shopping and meal preparation) but still in a communal setting. Volunteer house parents live in the house to provide guidance.</p>

<h2><span style="color: rgb(0, 121, 193); ">GREENSIDES AVENUE</span></h2>
<p>Our newest home, on Greensides Avenue, is divided into five separate apartments. Volunteer House Parents live in the main floor apartment, which includes a large, newly-renovated kitchen and gathering space for communal meals. At this house, residents are able to have the independence of living in their own apartment&nbsp;while still enjoying the camaraderie and support of other Matthew House friends.</p></div><div style="margin:0px;padding:0px;height:0px;clear:both;"></div>
