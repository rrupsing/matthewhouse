<p style="text-align: justify;">Matthew House had the pleasure of hosting a coalition of leaders from Toronto Refugee shelters today which happened to coincide with the release of a significant Federal Court decision. The Court has struck down a current policy which had barred access to the Refugee Appeal Division (RAD) for refugee claimants who came from designated countries of Origin (DCO) on the grounds that it discriminates on the basis of national origin. The Court declined to suspend its judgment so it means that EFFECTIVE IMMEDIATELY all refugee claimants from DCOs are entitled to an Appeal if their original case is unsuccessful! This is a huge milestone and reason for celebration.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Pictured celebrating the victory in the Matthew House yard are leaders from Sojourn House, Romero House, Adam House, Christie Refugee Welcome Centre, FCJ Refugee Centre, COSTI, Red Cross First Contact Program and Matthew House Toronto. We all send our congratulations and Thanks to the Canadian Association of Refugee Lawyers! Well done!!!</p></div>
