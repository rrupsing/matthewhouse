<p>The best gift you can give Matthew House is one that&nbsp;enables us to keep our doors of welcome open well into the future.&nbsp;Our 25:35 campaign is the medium through which you can do this.</p>
<p><strong>The 25:35 Challenge</strong>!&nbsp;is inspired by the same scripture passage for which Matthew House is named. Matthew 25:35 states: &ldquo;For I was hungry and you fed me, I was thirsty and you gave me something to drink, I was a stranger and you welcomed me...&rdquo;&nbsp;The campaign&nbsp;challenges&nbsp;people to become more active and informed about the plight of refugee claimants and to consider pledging $25.35 (or more) each month to help us remain sustainable well into the future.&nbsp; By being assured of ongoing support from year to year, Matthew House can make long range plans more confidently and continue to provide a warm welcome, shelter and support for vulnerable refugee claimants when they arrive in Canada.</p>
<p>In light of the current political climate, the need is greater than ever to stand up for the plight of refugee claimants. They are often the target of much misunderstanding and abuse. As part of our campaign, we have speakers ready to come out to share with small or large groups about the plight of refugees and the work of Matthew House. If you would like to have a speaker come to visit your group please contact us and call 416-364-8287. We&#39;d be glad to share the Matthew House story!</p>
<p>Pledges of monthly support can be given online by simply clicking on the blue DONATE NOW tab or by downloading the&nbsp;<strong><a href="/site/ywd_trialsite_1564/assets/pdf/MH-2535-brochure.pdf" target="_blank">Matthew 25:35 campaign brochure</a></strong>&nbsp;and mailing&nbsp;it in or by calling us at 416-364-8287.</p>
<p>Thank you and Merry Christmas!</p></div>
