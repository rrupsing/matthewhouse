<div class="newsbody"><p>Nighisti came to Matthew House from Ethiopia 8 years ago. When she arrived at our home, she did not know anyone nor where to turn for help with the confusing process of asking for asylum in Canada. Matthew House staff guided her with the process and helped her with all her settlement needs. We also became her first &quot;family&quot; in Canada. She really appreciated our support and after moving out, she came back and volunteered with us.&nbsp; She is a faithful friend of Matthew House and when she heard about the Scotiabank charity run, she decided to join in order to help raise support for her first &ldquo;home&quot; in Canada.</p>
<p>Recently she prepared some special Ethiopian food for our post-practice snack. While she does not consider herself an expert long distance runner (like some of her Ethiopian counterparts J), she is still planning to faithfully complete the 5K distance ideally in less than an hour.&nbsp; Thanks Nighisti for being such a great support and blessing to Matthew House!</p>
<p>There is still time to join our team.&nbsp; In fact, we would love to have more members!</p>
