While those of us in the Refugee Rights field have a lot of challenges in the present climate, one small positive step that we can celebrate is that yesterday the first &quot;Ready Tour&quot; was piloted in Toronto. Our&nbsp;local Immigration and Refugee Board (IRB) opened their doors for a group of refugee-serving agency partners to officially tour the IRB building with refugee claimants in order to familiarize them with the refugee hearing process &quot;before&quot; their actual hearing date. This visit <img alt="" src="/site/ywd_trialsite_1564/assets/images/Ready_Tour_group_April_3__14.jpg" style="width: 1024px; height: 645px;" />Special thanks to Dan Crawford from the IRB for his excellent facilitation of the tour. It is a step in the right direction. Happy Refugee Rights Day everyone!<a data-ft="{&quot;tn&quot;:&quot;e&quot;}" href="https://www.facebook.com/matthewhousetoronto?ref=hl#" role="button">See More</a></div></div>
