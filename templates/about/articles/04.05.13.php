Stories were shared&nbsp;re the importance of the day and many voiced their solidarity with the Canadian Council for Refugee's new campaign entitled &quot;Proud to Protect Refugees&quot;.&nbsp; A group of those present posed for the photo&nbsp;above showing our solidarity.&nbsp;We even had a cake together expressing the&nbsp;same theme.&nbsp; &nbsp;Included in the crowd was 1 month old baby Isaac, whose parents Lisa and Chris Van Dijk, are live-in&nbsp;house managers at our Shirley St. home.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Isaac too showed his support by holding a banner :-).</p>
