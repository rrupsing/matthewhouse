<div class="newsbody"><p>Former residents, volunteers, seekers&nbsp;and supporters of Matthew House all gathered at the <strong>Bloor Hot Docs Cinema</strong> on <strong>June 11th </strong>and were treated to a captivating evening.&nbsp;&nbsp; It began with the screening of the documentary film about the plight of unaccompanied minor refugee teens:&nbsp;<strong>Everybody&#39;s Children</strong>, introduced by the director <strong>Monica Delmos</strong>.&nbsp; After the film a panel discussion took place hosted by CBC radio&#39;s <strong>Anna Maria Tremonti.&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>A youth featured in the film, Salieu from Sierra Leone,&nbsp;was part of the 4 member panel of young people who had originally come to Canada as unaccompanied refugee teens.&nbsp; The evening closed with one of the panelists, Elisee from the Democratic Republic of Congo, singing a lovely song about overcoming hardship with hope in her native language, Lingala.&nbsp;We also officially launched our new <strong>Flight to Freedom </strong>program which provides much needed&nbsp;help for refugees preparing&nbsp;for their hearing.&nbsp;&nbsp;It was a wonderful evening from start to finish and we are grateful for all who came and supported our work.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Some have since approached us expressing interest in having the documentary shown at their&nbsp;particular group.&nbsp; If you would like to arrange a showing please contact us at <a href="mailto:admin@matthewhouse.ca">admin@matthewhouse.ca</a></p>
<p>Many guests&nbsp;were given beautiful hand-painted butterfly fridge magnets created by our former resident Jo Djenar, an artist&nbsp;from Indonesia, as a token of appreciation.</p>
