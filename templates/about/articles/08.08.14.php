<p>Matthew House summer student Kelsey Franklin prepares to welcome guests to our <strong>16th Anniversary celebration </strong>Tuesday August 5th in the newly transformed back yard of Matthew House, Dundas St.&nbsp; A&nbsp;good number of former residents, volunteers and friends of Matthew House&nbsp;joined us in&nbsp;celebrating another milestone in our history.&nbsp; An &quot;international potluck&quot; was shared and enjoyed by all and people had the opportunity to hear the latest updates in the life of Matthew House - which included an&nbsp;invitation to join what we hope will be our largest team ever in the <strong>Scotiabank Waterfront Charity marathon&nbsp;</strong>on <strong>October 19th</strong>. ( See details&nbsp;on how to join by clicking&nbsp;our <strong>Events</strong> tab).</p>
<p>Thanks to the contruction skills&nbsp;of our new volunteer&nbsp;night manager Gary Moorehead &nbsp;( pictured below sampling water at our new fountain feature! ) and a team of very helpful&nbsp;residents, a beautiful new pergola and wooden screen has been added to our&nbsp;future &quot;<strong>healing garden</strong>&quot; space.&nbsp; Thank you Gary and friends!&nbsp;</p>
<p>And&nbsp;stay tuned for news on the official &quot;opening&quot; of our healing garden.</p>
