<div class="newsbody"><p>It is with both sadness and thanksgiving for a life well-lived, that we announce the passing of &ldquo;Clare&rdquo; Webb, a former Chair of the Matthew House Toronto Board, on December 11, 2012.</p>
<p>Clarence was involved with Matthew House from its early days and served in many many volunteer capacities including Board Treasurer, Chair, public relations and fundraising, administration, book keeping and all-round &ldquo;cheerleader&rdquo; for Matthew House. In short, together with his wife Nancy, he played a pivotal role in helping Matthew House Toronto get off the ground and &ldquo;on the map&rdquo;, especially among convention Baptist churches in Ontario and Quebec. He was a great personal friend and encouragement to our founder Anne Woolger and will be dearly missed by Anne and many others.</p>
<p>Visitation for family and friends will take place at <a href="http://www.kingswaybaptist.ca/">Kingsway Baptist Church</a>, 41 Birchview Boulevard, Toronto from 2:00 &ndash; 4:00 p.m. and 7:00-9:00 p.m. on Friday, December 14th, 2012.</p>
<p>A celebration of Clare&rsquo;s life followed by a reception will be held at Kingsway Baptist Church, 41 Birchview Boulevard, Etobicoke on Saturday, December 15th at 2:00 p.m.</p>
<p>The family has kindly listed Matthew House as one of the charities to which memorial donations can be made in honour of Clarence.</p>
