<p>In just a few days, On October 19th,&nbsp;staff, volunteers, residents and friends of Matthew House Toronto will be taking to the streets and participating in the Scotiabank Waterfront Marathon ( half Marathon and 5km).&nbsp; While the majority of our team will be walking or running in the 5km event, our zeal makes up for the distance travelled.&nbsp; Everyone involved has a personal&nbsp;story as to why they believe in supporting Matthew House&#39;s work of welcoming and assisting newly arrived refugee claimants who would be otherwise homeless.</p>
<p>Several former residents will be running for Matthew House as an expression of their gratitude for the love and support they recieved while staying in our home.&nbsp; ( To read about and/or sponsor these residents, <a href="http://www.matthewhouse.ca/index.cfm?eventid=6970&amp;pagepath=Events&amp;id=49964#event6970">please click here</a>).</p>
<p>Pictured&nbsp;below is our Founder and Executive Director Anne Woolger pointing&nbsp;to the level we have reached on the fundraising Thermometre.&nbsp; We still have a long way to go and appreciate all the support we can get!!&nbsp; The sponsorship line will remain open until October 30th.&nbsp; Thank you to everyone who helped us reach our goals.</p>
