<div class="newsbody"><p>We are honored to have been visited today by an international delegation convened by the UNHCR. The 40 members are participating in a global round table on alternatives to refugee detention.</p>
<p>These delegates from all over the world had the opportunity to learn more about Matthew House, the services we offer our residents and our welcoming environment.</p>
<p>Delegates were fortunate to hear from two of our former residents who had been placed in detention upon arrival before coming to Matthew House. The delegation is exploring alternatives to detention centers, like Matthew House, for refugees and asylum seekers.</p>
<p>We are thrilled to display Matthew House to our international colleagues as a successfully operating alternative to detention</p>
