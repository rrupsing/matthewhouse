											<h6>THE MATTHEW HOUSE STORY</h6>
											<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 121, 193);">Matthew House grew out of the vision of its founder and current director, Anne Woolger,</span> who had worked for many years at a city-run shelter for refugees in Toronto. There, her eyes were opened to the plight of refugee claimants who were arriving in Canada seeking asylum as refugees&nbsp;but had no place to stay. Recognizing the need for caring shelters geared specifically toward the unique settlement needs of refugee claimants, Anne approached her denominational leaders and shared her vision of establishing a Christian-based reception home that would provide a warm welcome for refugee claimants in a caring home-like setting.</p>
											<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 121, 193);">In 1992, a Board of Directors was formed and Matthew House was incorporated as a non-profit charity. </span>Four years later in October 1996, Anne, appointed as the first director, was mandated to find and establish a permanent home for the refugee ministry. Since opening in 1998, over 1,300 refugees from 88 different nations have been warmly welcomed by caring volunteers and staff who provide the residents help with all their settlement needs, including assistance with paperwork, preparing for the&nbsp;refugee hearing,&nbsp;orientation to Canada, connection with social services and finding and furnishing apartments with donated furniture. Matthew House receives very little direct government support but exists simply through the generosity of individuals, churches, and foundations that care about the plight of refugees.</p>
											<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 121, 193);">Matthew House Toronto has expanded from having just one main shelter to having two additional homes</span> that provide second-stage transitional housing for the most vulnerable refugees who pass through its doors. In all three of its homes, Matthew House continues to fulfill its mission of providing expert settlement support to refugees in beautiful, family-like homes where their dignity and hope are restored.</p>
											<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 121, 193);">Matthew House has also been a catalyst </span>behind the establishment of more than half a dozen other refugee shelters across Canada ( some by the same name) based on the Matthew House Toronto model.</p>
