<div class="newsbody"><p>Sunday Oct. 20th was a great day for the Matthew House team where members participated in the Scotiabank marathon, half marathon and 5 km events in an effort to raise support for our work of welcoming and assisting newly arrived refugee claimants as they settle in Canada.&nbsp; Our goal was to raise $50,000.&nbsp; We are approaching $40,000. raised so far and the good news is that the donation&nbsp;site is&nbsp;still open until the end of October so if you have not&nbsp;given anything yet and would like to support our cause, please simply click on the Scotiabank Icon on our front web page and it will bring you to a link to the Scotiabank site where you can continue to make pledges for our team.&nbsp;&nbsp;Thank you!</p>
