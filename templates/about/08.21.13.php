<div class="newsbody"><p>Over 75 former residents and volunteers from Matthew House made their way&nbsp; to Muskoka&nbsp;on the&nbsp;weekend&nbsp; of August 16-18th to enjoy a time of fun and relaxation in the beautiful surroundings of Camp Kwasind.&nbsp; Some&nbsp;paddled in canoes and tasted marshmallows for the first time.&nbsp; Others simply breathed the&nbsp;fresh air and the breathtaking views of the lake and rocky cliffs.&nbsp; <img alt="" src="/site/ywd_trialsite_1564/assets/images/MH_Camp_2013_102.jpg" style="width: 1024px; height: 768px;" />&nbsp;And as always, the international <strong>talent show </strong>was a great highlight.&nbsp; Special thanks to everyone who contributed to sponsoring campers to attend this camp. It was awesome!</p></div>
